        <li>Q1.A: This is a sequantial scale.
            <br> This is an effective sequantial color scale since it has limited hue colors(2), and the color scale has smooth gradient.
        </li>
        <li>Q1.B:  This is not an effective color scale. Because it uses saturated color, blue, as middle. This makes the color scale dirty and unaesthetic. A neutral color like white will be better for the middle.
            Also, blue does not conceptually represent a neutral state of sentiment. Yellow does not conceptually presents dislike as well. This may lead confusion to people.
            In addition, if the data falls between yellow and blue, or between blue and red, it is difficult for people to judge the extent of sentiment.
            Therefore, the color scale is ineffective.
        </li>
        <li>Q1.C:Blue-Blind/Tritanopia (Dichromatic)
        </li>
        <li>Q1.D:No I would not recommend to use the rainbow scale to color the counties in their map.
            <br>The rainbow scale is not perceptually uniform, some colors like green and blue have much more rooms in the scale,
            whereas less room for colors like purple, orange and red. Also, there's abrupt color transitions to cyan and yellow.
            Therefore, these will lead to misinterpretation. It is hard for people to hard to judge place in scale.
            A sequential or diverging color scale will be more effective for continuous numeric data.

        <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> The advantage of the logarithmic color scale is that it makes data points with sutble variations more visible to people. 
            <br>Circles with small attemps now will receive virtually different colors from the color scales.
            <br><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Circles represent locations with high attempts are less stand out from the graph by using the logarithmic color scale compared with using original, linear scale.
